/*
 * You are advised NOT to add any tests here.
 * Create separate test-*.cpp files for this purpose.
 *
 * Why?
 * The main() function of Catch framework takes a long time to compile.
 * That's it.
 *
 * Conventionally, the file containing the main() function is therefore
 * left empty so that the main() is compiled only once and then reused
 * by the build system (Make, CMake).
 *
 * Changes to this file may force Make to recompile it again,
 * thus wasting precious time before the deadline :)
